# Small Team Workflow

> This workflow is based on [github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ "Github Workflow") inline link.
> This is not a dogmatic workflow and feel free to modify and make improvements depending on the project, the team, or preference.

## Workflow Checklist
* Each team member must have their own branches where they can work simulatneously with other developers. This allows the developer to commit their own work and unit test their work safely without affecting others work.
