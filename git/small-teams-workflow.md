## Workflow Checklist
* __Create and Provide Branches to Developers As Needed__ 
Each team member must have their own branches where they can work simulatneously with other developers. This allows the developer to commit their own work and unit test their work safely without affecting others work. Senior developers or the project manager can name this branch very descriptively or just by prefixing those developer branches, for example ``dev-ariel``, ``dev-arriz``, or ``dev-vic``. It is a good idea as well to create branches from a certain milestone or features with a ``dev`` prefix like ``dev-milestone-1``, ``dev-build-1.0``, or ``dev-db-layer``.

* __Avoid Developers Committing in a Single Branch__
